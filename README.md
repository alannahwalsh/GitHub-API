# Github-API

Task 1:
Interrogate the GitHub API to retrieve and display data regarding the logged in developer.
I used the PyGitHub library to interrogate the API. Using my personal access token, I print information about my repos. The python code is found at commit f1d7a4c. A screenshot of the output is attached.
