# Github-API

Task 1:
Interrogate the GitHub API to retrieve and display data regarding the logged in developer.
I used the PyGitHub library to interrogate the API. Using my personal access token, I print information about my repos. The python code is found at commit f1d7a4c. A screenshot of the output is attached.

Task 2:
Interrogate the GitHub API to build visualisation of data available that elucidates some aspect of the softare engineering process, such as a social graph of developers and projects, or a visualisation of indiviudal of team performance. Provide a visualisation of this using the d3js library. For this task, I used JavaScript to access the API. I used a line chart from the d3js library to display a user's repos against stars on a repo.
